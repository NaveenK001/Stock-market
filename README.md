Stock Market Prediction using LSTM
Introduction
This project aims to predict future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly effective for time-series forecasting problems like stock price prediction.
Objectives
Predict future stock prices based on historical stock data.
Implement and train an LSTM model to capture the temporal dependencies in stock prices.
Evaluate the performance of the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
Numpy
TensorFlow/Keras
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock price data, including features like Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume.
Source of data: Yahoo Finance (or any other API/source you used).
How it Works
Data Preprocessing: The data is scaled using MinMaxScaler, and a sliding window is used to create sequences of stock prices for training.
LSTM Model Architecture:
Input layer: LSTM cells with 50 units
Output layer: Fully connected layer with one unit (predicting the stock price)
Training: The model is trained on 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% used for testing.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict future stock prices, which are compared against the actual prices to evaluate performance.
Results
The model produces predicted stock prices plotted against actual prices. Example of results:


Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.00123 (example)
Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional features like news sentiment or economic indicators to improve the model.
Experiment with other models like ARIMA or Random Forest for better comparison.
